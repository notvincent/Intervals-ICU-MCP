# How to Write a Training Plan

A comprehensive guide to creating an effective cycling training plan.

## Step 1: Ask the athlete what their goals are for the traning plan

- Choose a clear objective: race, endurance ride, FTP boost, or general fitness
- Make it SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- Example: "Increase FTP by 15 watts in 12 weeks"

## Step 2: Assess the athlete's current fitness

- Look at the athletes recent activities to see how much training they are doing and where they are at
- Do a baseline test that best measures what their goal is: FTP test, VO2max, or a simple time trial
- Track metrics like heart rate zones, power output, and perceived exertion

## Step 3: Make a high level plan of how the phases will go

Break your plan into phases:

- **Base**: Typically during the winter months, in this phase it's also good to do heavy gym work
- **Build**: Add intensity and volume, you should try doing 4-8 week blocks with each block alternating between a polarized, and pyramidal approach.
- **Taper** (1–2 weeks): Reduce volume, maintain intensity

Every week should include 3-4 workouts a week of intesity above z2, with the rest of the week filled with z2 or recovery rides as time permits.

## Step 4: Track Progress & Adjust

- Re-test every 4–8 weeks
- Adjust volume or intensity based on fatigue, performance, and life stress
